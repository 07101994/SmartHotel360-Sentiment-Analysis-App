# SmartHotel360

During our **Connect(); 2017** event this year we presented beautiful app demos using Xamarin.

We are happy to announce the release of SmartHotel360. This release intends to share a simplified version of SmartHotel360 reference sample apps used at Connect(); 2017 Keynotes.

## Sentiment Analysis App
For hotel managers, we built a simple Node.js website to analyze customer sentiment from Twitter by using Text Analysis Cognitive Services APIs. This website was built with Visual Studio Code and we used multiple of our newest extensions for Cosmos DB, App Service, Azure Functions, and Docker for Visual Studio Code and Azure to build this app.

## Projects

This repo is under construction and within the next few days we will release the code and more details on this Readme. Please stay tuned!
